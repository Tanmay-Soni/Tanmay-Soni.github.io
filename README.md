# Coursera Course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers by Johns Hopkins University

Over the summer I worked on a Coursera Course offered by Johns Hopkins University: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers. As the course progressed I worked on it 
with different kinds of assessments, but as the course approached the end the final assessment was to make a final website for a dummy restaurant using everything I had learned,
and this is the repo represents what I did and the webpage can be seen on: [Tanmay-Soni.github.io](https://Tanmay-Soni.github.io)
